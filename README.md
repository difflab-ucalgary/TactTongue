# TactTongue: Prototyping Electrotactile Stimulations on the Tongue

This is the repository that contains the hardware and software ecosystem for the "TactTongue: Prototyping Electrotactile Stimulations on the Tongue" paper (ACM UIST 2023).

# Note
Due to the concerns about unsafe AC Wall adaptors on the market, we recommend that the device be powered through a computer USB or a battery.

Code cleaning and Optimization are still in progress.
